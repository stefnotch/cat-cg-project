## Game concept

Restoring any point in the past, but it doesn't affect your character.

So you can totally walk up to a table, and pick up the fancy sword. 

Then load the past (save) where the sword was still on the table. And since that didn't affect your character, you now have a sword on the table, *and a sword in your hand*!

Should make for an interesting puzzle game. Or a stealth:tm: game, because you can always openly smack the guy in front of you, get to the next area...and then just load the past where the guard was still alive and didn't alert the entire facility.
